# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# Product Management App

## Overview

This project is a **Product Management Application** built with a **React** frontend using **Vite**, and a backend powered by **Supabase** with a **PostgreSQL** database. The app is deployed using **Vercel** for seamless scalability and ease of deployment.

## Frontend

The frontend of the application is built with **React** and **Vite**.

### Why React + Vite?
- **React**: React is a powerful library for building dynamic user interfaces. It provides a component-based architecture that allows for reusable and maintainable code.
- **Vite**: Vite is a fast build tool that is optimized for modern JavaScript frameworks. It offers several advantages over traditional bundlers like Webpack:
  - **Fast Development**: Vite uses native ES modules to speed up the development process, allowing for faster hot module reloading (HMR).
  - **Optimized Build Process**: Viteâ€™s build process is highly optimized for production, reducing the final bundle size and improving performance.

### Why Not Redux?
Given the relatively small size and simplicity of the codebase, I opted not to use **Redux** for state management. Instead, I rely on **React's built-in hooks** (`useState`, `useEffect`, and `useContext`) to handle state management. This approach:
- Keeps the code simpler and more maintainable.
- Reduces the need for additional boilerplate code typically required with Redux.
- Is perfectly suitable for the scale of this project, where the complexity of state management is minimal.

## Backend

The backend of the application is powered by **Supabase** with a **PostgreSQL** database and **Prisma** ORM.

### Why Supabase + PostgreSQL + Prisma?
- **Supabase**: Supabase is an open-source alternative to Firebase. It offers a fully managed backend service, including authentication, real-time data, and file storage. It's a perfect choice for rapid development with minimal overhead.
- **PostgreSQL**: PostgreSQL is a powerful, open-source relational database. It's highly reliable, supports complex queries, and integrates seamlessly with Supabase.
- **Prisma**: Prisma is an ORM that simplifies database interactions. It allows me to write clean and type-safe database queries in JavaScript/TypeScript, making database management more efficient and less error-prone.

## Deployment

The application is deployed on **Vercel**, a platform optimized for frontend and full-stack applications.

### Why Vercel?
- **Easy Deployment**: Vercel provides an easy-to-use CI/CD pipeline that automatically deploys the application whenever code is pushed to the repository.
- **Scalability**: Vercel handles scaling automatically, ensuring that the app can handle increased traffic without manual intervention.
- **Integration with GitHub**: Vercel integrates seamlessly with GitHub, allowing for one-click deployments from the repository.
- **Performance**: Vercel optimizes the frontend application for performance, providing automatic optimizations such as image optimization and code splitting.
